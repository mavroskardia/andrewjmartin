              Having a really common name has made it really easy to hide in plain sight, especially
              when there are so many other far more amazing
              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Martin_(disambiguation)">Andy Martins</a>
              out there.

              After being born and raised in Wisconsin, which does funny things to speech patterns
              and accents, I moved to Gainesville, Florida. I live here with my incredible wife and kids.

              I am a lifelong computer enthusiast. I have fond memories of our family's first computer:
              a Packard Bell 386SX running MS-DOS 5.0 on a 10MB HDD with 4MB of memory. Even before that,
              having encounters with my neighbor's Commodore 64 and then my friend's Apple IIc, I knew
              from an early age what I wanted to be when I grew up.
